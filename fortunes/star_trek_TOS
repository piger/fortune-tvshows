Uhura: There has been no response as yet, sir.
Spock: Did you advise them the Captain's life is at stake?
Uhura: Yes, sir. They insist the matter must be referred to the
       Federation.
Spock: What department?
Uhura: The Bureau of Planetary Treaties.
Spock: Contact them directly.
Uhura: I did, Mr. Spock. They insist that we must go through Starfleet
       channels.

Hodin: The people of Gideon have always believed that life is sacred.
       That the love of life is the greatest gift. That is the one
       unshakable truth of Gideon. And this overwhelming love of life
       has developed our regenerative capacity and our longevity.
Kirk: And the great misery which you now face.
Hodin: That is bitterly true, Captain. Nevertheless, we cannot deny
       the truth which shaped our evolution. We are incapable of
       destroying or interfering with the creation of that which we
       love so deeply-- life in every form-- from fetus to developed
       being.

Kirk: You said something about savagery, Mr. Flint. When was the last
      time you visited Earth?
Flint: You would tell me that it is no longer cruel. But it is,
       Captain. Look at your starship. Bristling with weapons. Its
       mission to colonize, exploit, destroy if necessary to advance
       Federation causes.
Kirk: Our missions are peaceful, our weapons defensive. If we were
      barbarians, we would not have asked for rytalin. Indeed, your
      greeting, not ours, lacked a certain benevolence.
Flint: The result of pressures which are... not... your concern
Kirk: Yes, well, those pressures are everywhere, in everyone, urging
      him to what you call savagery. The private hells, the inner
      needs and mysteries, the beast of instinct. As human beings,
      that is the way it is. To be human is to be complex. You can't

Kirk: [surprised] Dr. Sevrin is their leader?
Spock: Yes. A brilliant research engineer in the fields of acoustics,
       communications and electronics on Tiberon. He was dismissed
       from his post when he started this movement. Tong Rad inherits
       his father's extraordinary abilities in the field of space
       studies.
Kirk: But... they've rejected all that, and all that this technology
      provides. And they seek the primitive.
Spock: There are many who are... uncomfortable with what we have
       created. It is almost a biological rebellion. A profound
       revulsion against the planned communities. The programming. The
       sterilized, artfully balanced atmospheres. They hunger for an
       Eden... where spring comes.
Kirk: We all do. The cave is deep in our memory.
Spock: Yes, that is true, Captain.
Kirk: But we don't steal space cruisers and act like irresponsible
      children. What makes you so sympathetic toward them?
Spock: It is not "sympathy" so much as curiosity, Captain. A wish to
       understand. They regard themselves as aliens in their own
       worlds. A condition with which I am somewhat familiar.
