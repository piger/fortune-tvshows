[Adama's speech at Galactica's decommissioning ceremony.]

William Adama: The Cylon War is long over, yet we must not forget the
               reasons why so many sacrificed so much in the cause of
               freedom. The cost of wearing the uniform can be high
               ...  [after looking at crowd]  but sometimes it's too
               high. You know, when we fought the Cylons, we did it to
               save ourselves from extinction. But we never answered
               the question, why? Why are we as a people worth saving?
               We still commit murder because of greed, spite,
               jealousy. And we still visit all of our sins upon our
               children. We refuse to accept the responsibility for
               anything that we've done. Like we did with the Cylons.
               We decided to play God, create life. When that life
               turned against us, we comforted ourselves in the
               knowledge that it really wasn't our fault, not really.
               You cannot play God then wash your hands of the things
               that you've created. Sooner or later, the day comes
               when you can't hide from the things that you've done
               anymore.

President Laura Roslin: The lesson learned here is not to ask follow-
                        up questions, but simply to say "Thank you,

Adama: You can run if you'd like. This ship will stand and it will

[Adama's speech at the funeral services on Galactica.]

Adama: Are they the lucky ones? That's what you're thinking, isn't it?
       We're a long way from home. We've jumped way beyond the Red
       Line, into uncharted space. Limited supplies, limited fuel. No
       allies, and now, no hope? Maybe it would have been better for
       us to have died quickly, back on the Colonies with our
       families, instead of dying out here slowly, in the emptiness of
       dark space. Where shall we go? What shall we do? Life here
       began out there. Those are the first words of the sacred
       scrolls, and they were told to us by the Lords of Kobol, many
       countless centuries ago. And they made it perfectly clear that
       we are not alone in this universe. Elosha, there's a 13th
       colony of humankind, is there not?
Elosha: Yes. The scrolls tell us a 13th tribe left Kobol in the early
        days. They travelled far and made their home upon a planet
        called Earth, which circled a distant and unknown star.
Adama: It's not unknown. I know where it is! Earth. The most guarded
       secret we have. The location was only known by the senior
       commanders of the fleet, and we dare not share it with the
       public. Not while there was a Cylon threat upon us. For now we
       have a refuge to go to. A refuge the Cylons know nothing about.
       It won't be an easy journey. It'll be long, and arduous. But I
       promise you one thing: on the memory of those lying here before
       you, we shall find it, and Earth shall become our new home. So
       say we all!

[Lee orders Kara to take stimulants and she refuses]

Lt. Kara 'Starbuck' Thrace: Why are we arguing about this?
Captain Lee 'Apollo' Adama: I have no idea.
Starbuck: Neither do I! You're the CAG, act like one.
Apollo: What the hell does that mean?
Starbuck: It means that you're still acting like you're everyone's
          best friend. We're not friends, you're the CAG. "Be careful
          out there"? Our job isn't to be careful, it's to shoot
          Cylons out of the frakking sky! "Good Hunting" is what you
          say. And now one of your idiot pilot is acting like a child
          and refusing to take her pills. So she either says 'Yes,
          sir' and obeys a direct order, or you smack her in the
          mouth, and you drag her sorry ass down to sickbay, and you
          MAKE her take those pills.

laughter]

Apollo: Well, I'm glad I'm not working for you.
Starbuck: You're damn right you're glad...
Apollo: So, do I have to smack you on the mouth, Lieutenant?

Adama: You sound like some kind of lawyer.
Roslin: This is unacceptable.
Apollo: I swore an oath. To defend the articles. The articles say
        there is an election in seven months. Now, if you are telling

[The closing voice-over narration to D'anna Biers' documentary on the
Battlestar Galactica, which runs over a montage of images from the
ship. The Colonial Anthem tinkles in the background and gradually
builds to up to a grand swell.]

Biers: I came to Galactica to tell a story. In all honesty I thought I
       knew what that story was before I ever set foot there: how an
       arrogant military let their egos get in the way of doing their
       jobs, safeguarding the lives of the civilian population. But I
       found out that the truth was more complex than that. These
       people aren't Cylons. They're not robots blindly following
       orders and polishing their boots. They're people. Deeply
       flawed, yes, but deeply human too, and maybe that's saying the
       same thing. What struck me most is that despite it all - the
       hardships, the stress, the ever present danger of being killed
       - despite all that, they never give up. They never lie down in
       the road and let the truck run them over. They wake up in the
       morning, put on their uniforms and do their jobs. Every day. No
       pay, no rest, no hope of ever laying down the burden or letting
       someone else do the job. There are no relief troops coming, no
       Colonial Fleet training new recruits every day. The people on
       Galactica are it. They are the thin line of blue that separates
       us from the Cylons. Lt. Gaeta told me a remarkable statistic;
       not a single member of Galactica's crew has asked to resign,
       not one. Think about that. If you wore the uniform wouldn't you
       want to quit? To step aside and say "enough! Let someone else
       protect the fleet"? I know I would. But then, I don't wear a
       uniform. Most of us don't, most of us never will. The story of
       Galactica isn't that people make bad decisions under pressure,
       it's that those mistakes are the exception. Most of the time
       the men and women serving under Commander Adama get it right.
       The proof is that our fleet survives. And with Galactica at our
       side, we will endure. This is D'anna Biers, Fleet News Service.

Number One: Let's review, why we're here shall we? Uh, we're supposed
            to bring the word of "God" to save the people, right? To
            save humanity from damnation, by bringing the love of
            "God" these poor, benighted people.
Caprica-Six: We're here because the majority of the Cylons felt that
             the slaughter of mankind had been a mistake.
Boomer: We're here to find a new way to live in peace. As God wants us
        to live.
Number One: And it's been a fun ride so far. But I want to clarify our
            objectives. If we're bringing the word of "God", it
            follows that we should employ any means necessary to do
            so. Any means. Yes, fear is a key article of faith as I
            understand it, so perhaps it's time to instill a little
            more fear into the people's hearts and minds. Let's uh,
            let's execute Baltar.
Baltar: What? What?!
Caprica-Six: That's not gonna happen.
Number One: Just because he's your favorite toy shouldn't interfere
            with the larger issues here.
Baltar: I think that I have co-operated-
Caprica-Six: Gaius is with me. Anyone that wants to challenge that
             will have to deal with me.
Number Five: Well it doesn't matter. If we killed him at the
             beginning, it might've worked. But now most humans think
             of him as a traitor, and might actually cheer his death.
Number One: Fine, fine. We don't kill Baltar. We round up the leaders
            of the insurgency and we execute them, publicly. We round
            up at random, groups off the street and we execute them,
            publicly. Send a message that the gloves are coming off,
            the insurgency stops now or else we start reducing the
            human population to a more mangeable size. I don't know,
            say less than a thousand.
Boomer: We need to stop being butchers.
Caprica-Six: The entire point of coming here was to start a new way of
             life. To push past the conflict that seperated us from
             humans for so long.
Number One: And what has it gotten us? It's not like they welcomed us

Lee: Well, because the evidence does not support the charges.
Lampkin: Come on...
Lee: Did the defendant make mistakes? Sure he did, serious mistakes,
     but did he actually commit any crimes? Did he commit treason? No.
     It was an impossible situation. When the Cylons arrived what
     could he possibly do? What could anyone have done? I mean, ask
     yourself, what would you have done? What would you have done? If
     he had refused to surrender, the Cylons would've probably nuked
     the planet, right then and there. So did he appear to co-operate
     with the Cylons? Sure, so did hundreds of others. What's the
     difference between him and them? The President issued a blanket
     pardon. They were all forgiven, no questions asked. Colonel Tigh?
     Colonel Tigh used suicide bombers, killed dozens of people,
     forgiven. Lieutenant Agathon and chief Tyrol murdered an officer
     on the  Pegasus , forgiven. The admiral? The admiral instituted a
     military coup d'etat against the President, forgiven. And me?
     Well, where do I begin? I shot down a civilian passenger ship,
     the  Olympic Carrier , over a thousand people on board, forgiven.
     I raised my weapon to a superior officer, committed an act of
     mutiny, forgiven. And then on the very day when Baltar
     surrendered to those Cylons, I, as commander of  Pegasus , jumped
     away! I left everybody on that planet, alone, undefended for
     months. I even tried to persuade the admiral never to return, to
     abandon you all there for good. If I'd had my way nobody would
     have made it off that planet. I'm the coward, I'm the traitor,
     I'm forgiven. I'd say we're very forgiving of mistakes. We make
     our own laws now, our own justice, and we've been pretty creative
     with ways to let people off the hook. For everything from theft
     to murder. And we've had to be, because we're not a civilization
     anymore, we are a gang, and we're on the run, and we have to
     fight to survive. We have to break rules, we have to bend laws,
     we have to improvise! But not this time, no, not this time, not
     for Gaius Baltar. No, you, you have to die! You have to die,
     because, well, because we don't like you very much. Because
     you're arrogant, because you're weak, because you're a coward,
     and we, the mob, want to throw you out the airlock because you
     didn't stand up to the Cylons and get yourself killed in the
     process! That's justice now! You should've been killed back on
     New Caprica, but since you had the temerity to live, we're going
     to execute you now. That's justice!
[ crowd murmurs angrily ]

Judge: Order, order!
Lee: This case, this case is built on emotion, on anger, bitterness,
     vengeance, but most of all it's built on shame. It's about the
     shame of what we did to ourselves back on that planet. It's about
     the guilt of those of us who ran away, who ran away. And we are
     trying to dump all of that guilt and all that shame onto one man,
     and then flush him out the airlock, and just hope that that gets
     rid of it all. So that we can live with ourselves. But that won't
     work. That won't work. That's not justice, not to me. Not to me.

Adama: Earth is a dream...one we've been chasing for a long time.
       We've earned it. This is Earth.

Roslin: So much...life...
Adama: It's a rich continent. More wildlife than all the 12 Colonies
       put together. Just looking for a quiet place for that cabin.
       Maybe a garden...I don't have much of a green thumb so I hope
       that you do-  [sees Roslin dead; she passed away while Adama

his last spoken words in the series are to her]

Adama: I laid out the cabin today. It's gonna have an easterly view.
       You should see the light that we get here. When the sun comes
       from behind the mountains, it's almost heavenly. It reminds me
       of you.

[150,000 years later, in present-day New York; Virtual Six and Virtual
Baltar are reading a  National Geographic   Magazine ]

Virtual Six: [reading]  "At a scientific conference this week at the
             Smithsonian Institution  in Washington, the startling
             announcement was made that archeologists believe they
             found fossilized remains of a young woman who may
             actually be  Mitochondrial Eve . Mitochondrial Eve is the
             name scientists have given to the most recent common
             ancestor for all humans now living on Earth. She lived in
             what is now  Tanzania , over 150,000 years ago."
Virtual Baltar: [Smiles]  Along with her Cylon mother, and Human
                father.  [The two walk amongst the crowd, seemingly
                unnoticed]
Virtual Six: Commercialism, decadence, technology run amok. Remind you
             of anything?
Virtual Baltar: Take your pick. Kobol. Earth...the real Earth, before
                this one. Caprica before the fall.
Virtual Six: All of this has happened before.
Virtual Baltar: But the question remains, does all of this have to
                happen again?
Virtual Six: This time I bet no.
Virtual Baltar: [Stops]  You know, I've never known you to play the
                optimist. Why the change of heart?
Virtual Six: Mathematics. Law of averages. Let a complex system repeat
             itself long enough and eventually something surprising
             might occur. That, too, is in God's plan.
Virtual Baltar: [Serious]  You know it doesn't like that name. [Six
                gives Baltar a defiant look]  Silly me. Silly, silly
                me.  [The two walk arm-in-arm off into the streets.]

Hybrid: Progress reports arriving. The farms of Aerolon are burning.
        The beaches of Canceron are burning. The plains of Leonis are
        burning. The jungles of Scorpia are burning. The pastures of
        Tauron are burning. The harbors of Picon are burning. The
        cities of Caprica are burning. The oceans of Aquaria are
        burning. The courthouses of Libran are burning. The forests of

Number Two/Leoben: I'm telling you. She flew a Raider. Learned how to
                   control it from the inside. Nobody taught her how.

Galactica-Cavil: One of your counterparts managed to get himself outed

Number Five: I can't understand how he was discovered. I heard it was
             Dr. Baltar.
Galactica-Cavil: Well, no. I'm not talking about that, exactly. I'm
                 talking about the fact that you're walking around
                 this fleet wearing that jacket and, more importantly,
                 that face. You're recognizable.
Number Five: His jacket was burgundy. This is teal.

Galactica-Cavil: No one was supposed to be alive! Our people were
                 supposed to be positioned to cause destruction, not
                 to mop up afterwards! My Two was the Defense
                 Minister's yoga instructor! If you can believe that.
                 And one of the Sixes was a prostitute! But the only
                 one in a position to do any frakking damage was a
                 Five on this ship and he frakked it up! Now the
                 universe still has these cockroaches in it. And we
                 can't have any peace until we step on them all.

[Tough-Six and Galactica-Cavil drunkenly lament on the failure of the
Cylons to destroy the Fleet]

Number Six: You want a progress report? I'll give you a frakkin'
            progress report.
Galactica-Cavil: Oh, no. Please don't. Please don't.
Number Six: Oh, come on, it is spectacular. Doral blew himself up,
            causing minor damage to a minor hallway. And Boomer
            jettisoned the water, and then, she personally found loads
            more water.  [Laughs]  And then she shot Adama, but not
            very accurately, since she loved him. And then, Leoben, he
            got obsessed with Kara Thrace, and then was captured and
            airlocked. And my sister Six utterly failed to discredit
            Baltar and his dreamy hair and destroyed our frakkin'
            cover in the process. And now Simon...Simon killed
            himself, really killed himself, out of resurrection range,
            without blowing up the ship that he lived on because he
            couldn't imagine life without his little human wife and
            his little human daughter because he loves them...
Galactica-Cavil: Stop, stop, stop.
Number Six: Guess I'd better.
Galactica-Cavil: Yes. They're all letting me down.
Number Six: Why are they letting you down, One? What's the x-factor?
            [She takes the bottle]  You can't declare war on love.

Shelly Godfrey: Baltar, he...he helped us so much on Caprica.
Galactica-Cavil: Are you attracted to this human?
Shelly Godfrey: No!
Galactica-Cavil: Because the other Six was addicted to him.
Shelly Godfrey: I am not addicted to him! Baltar is a brilliant man,
                yes, but you should have seen me. I was brutal with
                him, I pushed him!
Galactica-Cavil: You  pushed  him? My dear, if you pushed him you
                 would have sent him through a wall! Oh look, an

Caprica-Cavil: Is there a Resurrection Ship within range?
Galactica-Cavil: Yes, brother. But first we're gonna die in a vacuum.
Caprica-Cavil: There's a 170 foot long launch tube in front of us. We
               might die of our injuries before we get to the vacuum.
Galactica-Cavil: I don't like you.
Caprica-Cavil: I understand that.
Galactica-Cavil: Do you really believe it was a mistake to attack the
                 humans?
Caprica-Cavil: Rather intensly, yes.
Galactica-Cavil: You know that when we download amongst the others
                 your strange ideas will be shouted down.
Caprica-Cavil: Ideas always seem strange until you try them on,
               brother. We had a temper-tantrum in the form of a
               cataclysm because we wanted them to treasure us, the
               Ones, more than humanity. More than their own history
               and blood.
Galactica-Cavil: We didn't want to be loved. We wanted to be treated
                 fairly.
Caprica-Cavil: We wanted to be held to a bosom. To be petted and
               perfumed and told we were the princes of the universe.
Galactica-Cavil: Yes, well if the humans were gone-
Caprica-Cavil: Our parents would mourn them. They'd love them more
               anyway.
Galactica-Cavil: I'm going to see to it that you get boxed. And then
                 I'm going to prepare to wipe out humanity once and
                 for all.
Caprica-Cavil: The anticipation is very unpleasant.
Galactica-Cavil: Yes.
[Caprica-Cavil offers his hand, Galactica-Cavil looks at it and
accepts it. Galactica-Cavil closes his eyes while Caprica-Cavil keeps
looking. They are then airlocked.]
